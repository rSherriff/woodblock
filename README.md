# Woodblock

Woodblock is a simple game manager and UI for Unity that allows the playing of games written in Ink.

It initially seeks to recreate the UI of the InkJS player allowing users with no scripting experience to customise and publish INK games with Unity.

It also introduces new functionality to this basis, audio and images. All controlled via tags in the Ink file rather than requiring scripting in Unity.

Finally, it also supports saving and loading (currently into one slot). Saving and Loading also works in web builds.

Woodblock is intended for student/hobbyist or small projects as its asset management of images and audio is done in a naive way. It could be extended to use more professional techniques such as asset bundles but this is not currently implemented.
